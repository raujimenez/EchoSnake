This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
So if you want to extend this project, simply run `npm start`.

# Background
I wanted to learn react, more specifically functional components in react, and so I implemented a simple snake game.
Building the snake game was kinda boring so I added a mechanic that is similar to the Ekko (league of legends character).

## Gettings Started
`npm install`
`npm start`
