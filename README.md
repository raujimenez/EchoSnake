# Background
I wanted to learn react, more specifically functional components in react, and so I implemented a simple snake game.
Building the snake game was kinda boring so I added a mechanic that is similar to the Ekko (league of legends character). 
Press space to deploy a portal and press space again to teleport back!

## Don't care and just want to play?
